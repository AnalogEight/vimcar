# Creating Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS

This SASS structure is based on the [SMACCS](https://smacss.com) principles.

We are splitting our sass in 4 types of categories:
1. Vendors: any external styles you want to use, e.g. the bourbon mixin lib
2. Base: your basic variables and basic rules applied to base elements
3. Module: 90% of your styling will be found here, class specific rules apply here
4. Layout: Think of the different page layout and create rules for them here
