## Illustration
Chose to go for a JSON productlist to emulate a REST-API backend instead of a hardcoded backend, since it's a frontend challenge.
Compiled all components into `app.js` to keep flexibility for later expansion.
Use of "js-" classes in html to show what components are javascript driven. They contain NO styling for this purpose.

## Components

For layout, used the Bootstrap grid.
All other components are written from scratch for this project.

## Technologies

Gulp, javascript and SASS
